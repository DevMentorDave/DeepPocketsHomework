# My DB schema updates

- Modified existing schema for account, income and expense
- Added goals, transactions, budgets
<br>

## Note

My understanding so far is that user has their planning and execution:
- Planning is done on budgets, execution is done on transactions.
- Income and expense items exists on both budget and transactions.
- Budget is just a plan that users draft based on what they plan.
- Transaction is the real execution of funds. This means that transaction is linked to accounts directly.
- Accounts also have a goal to serve as a milestone to be acheived in the end.
